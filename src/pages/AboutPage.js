            <p>Hello World!</p>
            <p>My name is Ju Hong Kim and I am a computer enthusiast. I love learning new things and expanding my knowledge.  
            My background is in Computer Science and I am particularly interested in reading and learning about Systems Programming 
            (though I am quite lacking in experience and knowledge). My current goals are to self-study more in depth about Operating Systems, 
            learn the basics of embedded programming, and work on old and new projects to improve my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently studying Mathematics and Physics at a random Canadian university. Previously I worked at IBM and studied Computer Science at another random 
                Canadian University.
            </p>
            <p>I initially self-studied programming on my free time around Middle School and High School particularly focusing on Web Design (Non Javascript Based Technologies) but got interested in Systems after being introduced to Linux.</p>
            <p>My hobbies outside of learning about Computers is to read manga and books, particularly Sci-fi Light Novels.</p>
